title: slow the process
---

In recent times I am noticing a recurring theme around me, in my peers and myself, in
strangers and my family. This essay is about the concept of *emphasizing the process*. It's
about why we should slow down.

## The Problem

Our youth, that part of our population that's supposed to take over the old man's work, is
getting poisoned by technology. Maybe not in the literal sense of the word, but it's
certainly not far off the mark. There is a whole generation out there that was raised with
high-level technology and the internet, but especially all kinds of social media, at their
fingertips. This alone isn't inherently a bad thing, the problematic part stems from the
unhealthy nature of this relationship. Nobody taught any of them how to properly interact
with mobile phones, the internet, social media or how to deal with online friendships.
It's become the new normal to spend upwards of ten hours on social media, to neglect AFK [0]
relationships and to become immersed in the digital realm, ~~for better or for worse~~ for
worse. To me it seems like the value of physical, interpersonal relationships that allow
migration of deeper emotions and feelings between both persons has diminished greatly in
tha last few years. Is this only caused by (anti-) social media and ever-progressing
digitalisation? I don't know, I have not done or read any research on this topic at all,
this is a total anecdote piece and of no significant value. This essay is mostly my way of
processing these thoughts, really. The issue and its many questions remain, however: how
can we help affected people? And how can we teach ~~young~~ people a responsible and healthy
behavior when it comes to (anti-) social media, to virtual relationships, well, to the new
digital world at the hands of everyone priviledged enough to be able to read this essay
probably on their phone at the coffee table? (I know, that's going off to another
unrelated [or is it?] tangent)

## The Solution?

I believe to regain control over our health, over our addiction to phones, to social media
and to the surge of dopamine we get when a bot likes our 120th #foodporn post on one of
evil Zuck's platforms, we need to disconnect ourselves from the fast-paced, ad-driven and
commercialised-to-the-brim-and-above world that encouraged this kind of behaviour.
My older brother, a whole twelve years wiser than me, got me into photography early on,
specifically analog photography. A lot of people think analog photography, or anything
analog for that matter, has been dead for a long time. Think vinyls, physical books, oil
painting, analog photography and whatever else you can think of. For every (let's say most)
hobby and activity that people engage in I believe there is an analog equivalent to the
modern, digital version of it.

[0] I prefer the acronym AFK (away from keyboard) to IRL (in real life) because the latter
suggests the digital world to be utterly disconnected from *real life*, which might've
been true ten or 15 years ago but certainly not anymore. Today, the term AFK seems a lot
more fitting to the actual circumstances around.
