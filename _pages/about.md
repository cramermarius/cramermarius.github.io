## I'm Marius!

Currently enrolled for aerospace engineering.
I tend to like tech, although not necessarily the overly capitalist parts of it, more so
the technical, engineering-related parts, if you will.
I'm also a film photographer, does that contradict the previous sentence?


Maybe, you decide.

In the words of Moxie Marlinspike, whom I look upto for his free mind, his adventurous
life and definitive focus on privacy and anonymity:

`I like computer security and software development, particularly in the areas of secure protocols, cryptography, privacy, and anonymity. But I also secretly hate technology.`
