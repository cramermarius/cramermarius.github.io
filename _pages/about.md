## I'm Marius!

Currently enrolled at HSBremen for aerospace engineering.
I tend to like tech, although not necessarily the overly capitalist parts of it, more so
the technical, engineering-related parts, if you will.
I'm also a film photographer, does that contradict the previous sentence?


Maybe, you decide.


#### Curious mind/hacker
According to Paul Graham, co-founder of YC, a hacker is a disobedient individual, someone
that doesn't take a no, be it from an idea inside their head, a physical lock or a system
admin. They possess an attitude of disobediance and an insatiable intellectual curiosity,
a hunger for knowledge of systems and their inner workings, be it an operating system or
something else.
