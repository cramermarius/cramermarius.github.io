## i'm marius!

<br/>

Currently enrolled for aerospace engineering.
I tend to like tech, although not necessarily the overly capitalist parts of it, more so
the technical, engineering-related parts, if you will.
I'm also a film photographer, does that contradict the previous sentence?

Recently I took up bagmaking, which is both one of the most fulfilling and most frustrating things I explored recently.

In the words of Moxie Marlinspike, whom I look upto for his free mind, his adventurous
life and definitive focus on privacy and anonymity:

`I like computer security and software development, particularly in the areas of secure protocols, cryptography, privacy, and anonymity. But I also secretly hate technology.`

<br/>

other trivia points about me:
* I like tinkering with colorschemes. This is what my custom one currently looks like.
  Maybe I'll clean it up a bit and release it some time... [0]
* (n)vim > emacs
* tabs > spaces
